						<p>Nikon and Canon are as good as each other overall.
						Each makes equally excellent lenses at the same price points,
						and each makes DSLRs with the same technical quality in each format.
						The differences lie in ergonomics and how well each camera handles,
						which is what allows you to get your photo â€” or miss it forever.
						Anyone who tries to tell you that one brand or the other is
						significantly better than the other in basic quality is either an
						idiot, or a retail salesman who's getting a bigger spiff from one 
						or the other that week. Each are multi-billion dollar optical 
						companies who have been making some of the world's best optics 
						for numerous consumer, industrial and military applications for 
						decades and decades and decades. Unlike other large corporations 
						like Sony and Panasonic that only make consumer and commercial 
						products, Nikon and Canon each make multi-million-dollar optical 
						products used in semiconductor manufacturing and space exploration.
						Nikon and Canon each are unique in having the nearly limitless 
						resources and experience needed to develop the "secret sauce" that 
						lets each make consumer cameras that render colors, highlights and 
						shadows subtly better than all the other mere consumer electronics 
						makers out there. Canon and Nikon can and do invest the effort to 
						fine-tune the "look" from each camera in the trade-secret color 
						matrices and algorithms that let each of their cameras deliver 
						results that just have a certain polish to them that I can't get 
						from Sony, Panasonic, Casio and all the rest of the companies 
						lacking Nikon and Canon's resources. With the huge corporate scope 
						and the huge camera sales volume, only Canon and Nikon can invest 
						the heavy resources that result in subtly better pictures from 
						each of their cameras, regardless of how inexpensive it may be.</p>
