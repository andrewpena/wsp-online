				<p>The D3S is uniquely qualified to meet the changing needs of photographers 
				whose assignments demand 100% from them and their equipment. Leading with 
				uncompromising FX-format multimedia versatility and engineered for demanding 
				professional use at up to 9 fps, the D3S' rugged magnesium alloy construction, 
				comprehensively sealed against dust and moisture, delivers on its promises of 
				superiority. Exacting moments in time are captured to an expanded buffer, allowing 
				continuous capture of up to 82 JPEG (fine) or 36 14-bit NEF (RAW) images. Nikon's 
				newly engineered, original 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor, teamed with exclusive 
				technologies such as EXPEED image processing, Nikon's Scene Recognition System 
				and a fast, accurate 51-area AF system, work together to assure that both still 
				and smooth 24 fps HD video files exhibit incredible edge-to-edge sharpness, 
				rich color depth and broad tonal range, while barrier-breaking performance enables 
				low-noise ISO sensitivity to 12,800. Expanded ISO sensitivities of 25,600, 51,200 
				and an astounding 102,400, shatter many long-standing rules of photography. 
				Audio to accompany HD video is preserved with a built-in microphone, while high 
				fidelity stereo sound is recorded through the external Mic input using an optional microphone. 
				More proven technologies include Nikon's renowned 1,005-pixel RGB 3D Color Matrix Metering II, 
				assuring exacting exposure evaluation and white balance detection. Precise image review and 
				menu access comes to life with the D3S' tempered glass-protected and individually 
				factory-calibrated 3-inch, 921,000-dot Live View monitor. A self-diagnostic shutter, 
				tested to beyond 300,000 cycles, and a myriad of inherent benefits stemming from decades 
				of Nikon design experience, round out the D3S' qualifications to meet the needs of professional photographers. </p>
