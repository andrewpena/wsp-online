				<p>The Nikon D90 is a fantastic camera. It's Nikon's newest and best DX 
				format DSLR. I prefer it to the old D300, which costs almost twice as much. 
				That's the way it goes with digital cameras: new is almost always better, 
				even for much less cost. The Nikon D90 is a fantastic camera. It's Nikon's 
				newest and best DX format DSLR. I prefer it to the old D300, which costs 
				almost twice as much. That's the way it goes with digital cameras: new is 
				almost always better, even for much less cost. The D90 has identical, or 
				slightly better technical image quality than the D300, the exact same rear LCD, 
				and adds several very useful ergonomic features for faster handling compared 
				to the D300. These handling improvements will let you react faster to conditions, 
				meaning you're more likely to get better pictures by being better prepared.
				If you're considering a D300, forget it. Get the D90 instead. The Nikon D90 
				is Nikon's newest and smartest DSLR. It has the same or better technical image 
				quality as the D300 that costs much more, and it handles better and it makes movies, too!
				The D90 is newer and better than the D300, for a fraction of the price, so long 
				as you prefer the D90's lighter plastic body. Let's be honest: I've used my plastic 
				D40 for years and it still works like new, so I don't see any reason to pay more for 
				a D300's metal body unless you're shooting sports all day. All these cameras have 
				metal lens mounts and are built to very high standards. The more I use the D90, 
				the more I like it. Compared to the old D300, the D90 offers the same or better 
				image quality, with many new features, in a lighter plastic package with the same 
				vivid and accurate 3" LCD and a much improved rear multi selector for faster handling. 
				The D90 also has better ergonomics than the D300 and D3, so it's easier to get 
				where you want in the menus faster. The D90 is super easy to use. As Nikon's newest 
				camera incorporating over 60 years of continuous innovation, it's got more clever 
				features, like a multiple-shot self timer, and a 72-image and calendar display if you 
				keep zooming out on playback, than any other Nikon to date. It all works intuitively, 
				and unlike the D3 and D300, I can operate everything with one hand. I have to waste a 
				frame to shoot a picture to get it to play images if I can't hit the PLAY button, but 
				I can get to all the menus and everything when set up as I like it in just one hand.</p>
